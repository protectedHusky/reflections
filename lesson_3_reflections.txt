When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-Because there could be little changes that you would not want to push. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-Forks: copies a repository to your Github. U can download it to your laptop too.
-Clones: Downloads to local laptop.
-Branches: Happens online. Does not copy the whole repository. Only the branch.
